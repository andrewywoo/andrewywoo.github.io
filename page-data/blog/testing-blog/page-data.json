We stand in support of racial equality. Enough is enough. Silence and complacency have no place in our world.</p>\n<p>I have been shocked and sick to my stomach witnessing the horrific and disturbing events that have taken place over the past few months across the United States. It is impossible to make sense of the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police or of Amy Cooper’s ugly behavior in Central Park. What makes it even more overwhelming are the many other violent events our country has experienced, including the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor in the recent past. These events are simply unacceptable, shocking, and shameful.</p>\n<p>I want to convey my sorrow and outrage over the loss of life and violence committed against communities of color. Any act of racism, mild or severe, sets a precedent for discrimination and inequality. I too have experienced acts of racism albeit relatively mild. Nevertheless, I remember them vividly and they troubled me deeply.</p>\n<p>The entire Tricentis leadership team and I care deeply about these tragedies and nationwide violence. They weigh heavily on our minds, and we know they must weigh on the minds of our employees, customers, partners.</p>\n<p>A poem that was written 100+ years ago by an Indian Nobel laureate captures my feeling today:</p>\n<p>Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;</p>\n<p>Where knowledge is free;</p>\n<p>Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;</p>\n<p>Where words come out from the depth of truth;</p>\n<p>Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;</p>\n<p>Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;</p>\n<p>Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action</p>\n<p>Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.</p>\n<p>– Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali</p>\n<p>Every day, we have an opportunity to make choices that help our community become more inclusive. It is important for us to take action to end systemic oppression. Here is a great list of resources—suggested by Tricentis employees—that help support and promote equality.
