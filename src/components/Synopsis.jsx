            Having worked as a software engineer for 8+ years across the stack,
            I've been exposed to many projects that solve a wide array of
            problems. These problems span from securities processing in fintech
            to growth engineering in e-commerce. I take a heavy interest in the
            web and the evolving landscape of web technologies. Front end web
            development is a major interest of mine as I strive to deliver great
            user experience through design.
